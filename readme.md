# Mr Thank You

Go/React app for my friend John Israel.

John is on a mission to send 5 thank you cards **every day for a year**.

This website will allow others to submit how many cards they've sent in order to
spread the love!

## Todo
- [ ] use [this](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) instead of pg. 73% faster!
- [ ] find a good mapping JS lib
- [ ] second part of submission form
- [ ] add basic auth admin section 
- [ ] add top nav/logo/social buttons
